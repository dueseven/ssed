This is a version of sed based on GNU sed.  It is not
a version of GNU sed, though.

There are several new features, including extended regular expression
syntax, and some bug fixes; see the NEWS file for a brief summary
and the ChangeLog for more detailed descriptions of changes.

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation
instructions.

See the file BUGS for instructions about reporting bugs.

The file README.boot gives instructions for making a "bootstrap"
version of sed on systems which lack any pre-existing and working
version of sed.
