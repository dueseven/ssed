<LI><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="#TOC1">DESCRIPTION</A>
<P>
The PCRE library is a set of functions that implement regular expression
pattern matching using the same syntax and semantics as Perl 5, with just a few
differences (see below). The current implementation corresponds to Perl 5.005,
with some additional features from later versions. This includes some
experimental, incomplete support for UTF-8 encoded strings. Details of exactly
what is and what is not supported are given below.
</P>
<P>
PCRE has its own native API, which is described in this document. There is also
a set of wrapper functions that correspond to the POSIX regular expression API.
These are described in the <B>pcreposix</B> documentation.
</P>
<P>
The native API function prototypes are defined in the header file <B>pcre.h</B>,
and on Unix systems the library itself is called <B>libpcre.a</B>, so can be
accessed by adding <B>-lpcre</B> to the command for linking an application which
calls it. The header file defines the macros PCRE_MAJOR and PCRE_MINOR to
contain the major and minor release numbers for the library. Applications can
use these to include support for different releases.
</P>
<P>
The functions <B>pcre_compile()</B>, <B>pcre_study()</B>, and <B>pcre_exec()</B>
are used for compiling and matching regular expressions.
</P>
<P>
The functions <B>pcre_copy_substring()</B>, <B>pcre_get_substring()</B>, and
<B>pcre_get_substring_list()</B> are convenience functions for extracting
captured substrings from a matched subject string; <B>pcre_free_substring()</B>
and <B>pcre_free_substring_list()</B> are also provided, to free the memory used
for extracted strings.
</P>
<P>
The function <B>pcre_maketables()</B> is used (optionally) to build a set of
character tables in the current locale for passing to <B>pcre_compile()</B>.
</P>
<P>
The function <B>pcre_info()</B> is used to find out information about a
compiled pattern.
</P>
<P>
The global variables <B>pcre_malloc</B> and <B>pcre_free</B> initially contain
the entry points of the standard <B>malloc()</B> and <B>free()</B> functions
respectively. PCRE calls the memory management functions via these variables,
so a calling program can replace them if it wishes to intercept the calls. This
should be done before calling any PCRE functions.
</P>
<LI><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="#TOC1">MULTI-THREADING</A>
<P>
The PCRE functions can be used in multi-threading applications, with the
proviso that the memory management functions pointed to by <B>pcre_malloc</B>
and <B>pcre_free</B> are shared by all threads.
</P>
<P>
The compiled form of a regular expression is not altered during matching, so
the same compiled pattern can safely be used by several threads at once.
</P>
<LI><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="#TOC1">COMPILING A PATTERN</A>
<P>
The function <B>pcre_compile()</B> is called to compile a pattern into an
internal form. The pattern is a C string terminated by a binary zero, and
is passed in the argument <I>pattern</I>. A pointer to a single block of memory
that is obtained via <B>pcre_malloc</B> is returned. This contains the
compiled code and related data. The <B>pcre</B> type is defined for this for
convenience, but in fact <B>pcre</B> is just a typedef for <B>void</B>, since the
contents of the block are not externally defined. It is up to the caller to
free the memory when it is no longer required.
</P>
<P>
The size of a compiled pattern is roughly proportional to the length of the
pattern string, except that each character class (other than those containing
just a single character, negated or not) requires 33 bytes, and repeat
quantifiers with a minimum greater than one or a bounded maximum cause the
relevant portions of the compiled pattern to be replicated.
</P>
<P>
The <I>options</I> argument contains independent bits that affect the
compilation. It should be zero if no options are required. Some of the options,
in particular, those that are compatible with Perl, can also be set and unset
from within the pattern (see the detailed description of regular expressions
below). For these options, the contents of the <I>options</I> argument specifies
their initial settings at the start of compilation and execution. The
PCRE_ANCHORED option can be set at the time of matching as well as at compile
time.
</P>
<P>
If <I>errptr</I> is NULL, <B>pcre_compile()</B> returns NULL immediately.
Otherwise, if compilation of a pattern fails, <B>pcre_compile()</B> returns
NULL, and sets the variable pointed to by <I>errptr</I> to point to a textual
error message. The offset from the start of the pattern to the character where
the error was discovered is placed in the variable pointed to by
<I>erroffset</I>, which must not be NULL. If it is, an immediate error is given.
</P>
<P>
If the final argument, <I>tableptr</I>, is NULL, PCRE uses a default set of
character tables which are built when it is compiled, using the default C
locale. Otherwise, <I>tableptr</I> must be the result of a call to
<B>pcre_maketables()</B>. See the section on locale support below.
</P>
<P>
The following option bits are defined in the header file:
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_ANCHORED
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If this bit is set, the pattern is forced to be "anchored", that is, it is
constrained to match only at the start of the string which is being searched
(the "subject string"). This effect can also be achieved by appropriate
constructs in the pattern itself, which is the only way to do it in Perl.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_CASELESS
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If this bit is set, letters in the pattern match both upper and lower case
letters. It is equivalent to Perl's /i option.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If this bit is set, a dollar metacharacter in the pattern matches only at the
end of the subject string. Without this option, a dollar also matches
immediately before the final character if it is a newline (but not before any
other newlines). The PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY option is ignored if PCRE_MULTILINE is
set. There is no equivalent to this option in Perl.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_DOTALL
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If this bit is set, a dot metacharater in the pattern matches all characters,
including newlines. Without it, newlines are excluded. This option is
equivalent to Perl's /s option. A negative class such as [^a] always matches a
newline character, independent of the setting of this option.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_EXTENDED
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If this bit is set, whitespace data characters in the pattern are totally
ignored except when escaped or inside a character class, and characters between
an unescaped # outside a character class and the next newline character,
inclusive, are also ignored. This is equivalent to Perl's /x option, and makes
it possible to include comments inside complicated patterns. Note, however,
that this applies only to data characters. Whitespace characters may never
appear within special character sequences in a pattern, for example within the
sequence (?( which introduces a conditional subpattern.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_EXTRA
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This option was invented in order to turn on additional functionality of PCRE
that is incompatible with Perl, but it is currently of very little use. When
set, any backslash in a pattern that is followed by a letter that has no
special meaning causes an error, thus reserving these combinations for future
expansion. By default, as in Perl, a backslash followed by a letter with no
special meaning is treated as a literal. There are at present no other features
controlled by this option. It can also be set by a (?X) option setting within a
pattern.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_MULTILINE
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
By default, PCRE treats the subject string as consisting of a single "line" of
characters (even if it actually contains several newlines). The "start of line"
metacharacter (^) matches only at the start of the string, while the "end of
line" metacharacter ($) matches only at the end of the string, or before a
terminating newline (unless PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set). This is the same as
Perl.
</P>
<P>
When PCRE_MULTILINE it is set, the "start of line" and "end of line" constructs
match immediately following or immediately before any newline in the subject
string, respectively, as well as at the very start and end. This is equivalent
to Perl's /m option. If there are no "\n" characters in a subject string, or
no occurrences of ^ or $ in a pattern, setting PCRE_MULTILINE has no
effect.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_UNGREEDY
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This option inverts the "greediness" of the quantifiers so that they are not
greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by "?". It is not compatible
with Perl. It can also be set by a (?U) option setting within the pattern.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_UTF8
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
This option causes PCRE to regard both the pattern and the subject as strings
of UTF-8 characters instead of just byte strings. However, it is available only
if PCRE has been built to include UTF-8 support. If not, the use of this option
provokes an error. Support for UTF-8 is new, experimental, and incomplete.
Details of exactly what it entails are given below.
</P>
<LI><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="#TOC1">STUDYING A PATTERN</A>
<P>
When a pattern is going to be used several times, it is worth spending more
time analyzing it in order to speed up the time taken for matching. The
function <B>pcre_study()</B> takes a pointer to a compiled pattern as its first
argument, and returns a pointer to a <B>pcre_extra</B> block (another <B>void</B>
typedef) containing additional information about the pattern; this can be
passed to <B>pcre_exec()</B>. If no additional information is available, NULL
is returned.
</P>
<P>
The second argument contains option bits.  At present, two options are
defined for <B>pcre_study()</B>, PCRE_STUDY_NO_PRUNE and PCRE_STUDY_NO_START,
which skip one of the available regex-studying algorithms.
</P>
<P>
The third argument for <B>pcre_study()</B> is a pointer to an error message. If
studying succeeds (even if no data is returned), the variable it points to is
set to NULL. Otherwise it points to a textual error message.
</P>
<P>
Studying a pattern is very useful for non-anchored patterns that do
not have a single fixed starting character or that start with a fixed-length
(no stars) pattern, because in this case PCRE builds data structures that
allow the matcher to skip several characters when looking for a place to
start matching.  This study can be inhibited by PCRE_STUDY_NO_START.
</P>
<P>
In addition, when PCRE_STUDY_NO_PRUNE is not specified, <B>pcre_study()</B>
tries to cut backtracking paths by looking for constructs such as [^;]*;
or \d*\. (if digits are to be followed by a period, which is not a digit,
there's no use in backtracking).  This often can limit the exponential
behavior of the matcher and speed up failing attempts to match a pattern.
</P>
<LI><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="#TOC1">LOCALE SUPPORT</A>
<P>
PCRE handles caseless matching, and determines whether characters are letters,
digits, or whatever, by reference to a set of tables. The library contains a
default set of tables which is created in the default C locale when PCRE is
compiled. This is used when the final argument of <B>pcre_compile()</B> is NULL,
and is sufficient for many applications.
</P>
<P>
An alternative set of tables can, however, be supplied. Such tables are built
by calling the <B>pcre_maketables()</B> function, which has no arguments, in the
relevant locale. The result can then be passed to <B>pcre_compile()</B> as often
as necessary. For example, to build and use tables that are appropriate for the
French locale (where accented characters with codes greater than 128 are
treated as letters), the following code could be used:
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "fr");
  tables = pcre_maketables();
  re = pcre_compile(..., tables);
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The tables are built in memory that is obtained via <B>pcre_malloc</B>. The
pointer that is passed to <B>pcre_compile</B> is saved with the compiled
pattern, and the same tables are used via this pointer by <B>pcre_study()</B>
and <B>pcre_exec()</B>. Thus for any single pattern, compilation, studying and
matching all happen in the same locale, but different patterns can be compiled
in different locales. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that the
memory containing the tables remains available for as long as it is needed.
</P>
<LI><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="#TOC1">INFORMATION ABOUT A PATTERN</A>
<P>
The <B>pcre_fullinfo()</B> function returns information about a compiled
pattern. The first argument for <B>pcre_fullinfo()</B> is a pointer to the
compiled pattern. The second argument is the result of <B>pcre_study()</B>,
or NULL if the pattern was not studied. The third argument specifies which
piece of information is required, while the fourth argument is a pointer to a
variable to receive the data. The yield of the function is zero for success,
or one of the following negative numbers:
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_ERROR_NULL       the argument <I>code</I> was NULL
                        the argument <I>where</I> was NULL
  PCRE_ERROR_BADMAGIC   the "magic number" was not found
  PCRE_ERROR_BADOPTION  the value of <I>what</I> was invalid
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The possible values for the third argument are defined in <B>pcre.h</B>, and are
as follows:
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_INFO_OPTIONS
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Return a copy of the options with which the pattern was compiled. The fourth
argument should point to au <B>unsigned long int</B> variable. These option bits
are those specified in the call to <B>pcre_compile()</B>, modified by any
top-level option settings within the pattern itself, and with the PCRE_ANCHORED
bit forcibly set if the form of the pattern implies that it can match only at
the start of a subject string.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_INFO_SIZE
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Return the size of the compiled pattern, that is, the value that was passed as
the argument to <B>pcre_malloc()</B> when PCRE was getting memory in which to
place the compiled data. The fourth argument should point to a <B>size_t</B>
variable.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_INFO_CAPTURECOUNT
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Return the number of capturing subpatterns in the pattern. The fourth argument
should point to an \fbint\fR variable.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_INFO_BACKREFMAX
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Return the number of the highest back reference in the pattern. The fourth
argument should point to an <B>int</B> variable. Zero is returned if there are
no back references.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_INFO_FIRSTCHAR
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
Return information about the first character of any matched string, for a
non-anchored pattern. If there is a fixed first character, e.g. from a pattern
such as (cat|cow|coyote), it is returned in the integer pointed to by
<I>where</I>. Otherwise, if either
</P>
<P>
(a) the pattern was compiled with the PCRE_MULTILINE option, and every branch
starts with "^", or
</P>
<P>
(b) every branch of the pattern starts with ".*" and PCRE_DOTALL is not set
(if it were set, the pattern would be anchored),
</P>
<P>
-1 is returned, indicating that the pattern matches only at the start of a
subject string or after any "\n" within the string. Otherwise -2 is returned.
For anchored patterns, -2 is returned.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_INFO_FIRSTTABLE
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
If the pattern was studied, and this resulted in the construction of a 256-bit
table indicating a fixed set of characters for the first character in any
matching string, a pointer to the table is returned. Otherwise NULL is
returned. The fourth argument should point to an <B>unsigned char *</B>
variable.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_INFO_LASTLITERAL
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
For a non-anchored pattern, return the value of the rightmost literal character
which must exist in any matched string, other than at its start. The fourth
argument should point to an <B>int</B> variable. If there is no such character,
or if the pattern is anchored, -1 is returned. For example, for the pattern
/a\d+z\d+/ the returned value is 'z'.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<LI><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="#TOC1">MATCHING A PATTERN</A>
<P>
The function <B>pcre_exec()</B> is called to match a subject string against a
pre-compiled pattern, which is passed in the <I>code</I> argument. If the
pattern has been studied, the result of the study should be passed in the
<I>extra</I> argument. Otherwise this must be NULL.
</P>
<P>
The PCRE_ANCHORED option can be passed in the <I>options</I> argument, whose
unused bits must be zero. However, if a pattern was compiled with
PCRE_ANCHORED, or turned out to be anchored by virtue of its contents, it
cannot be made unachored at matching time.
</P>
<P>
There are also three further options that can be set only at matching time:
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_NOTBOL
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The first character of the string is not the beginning of a line, so the
circumflex metacharacter should not match before it. Setting this without
PCRE_MULTILINE (at compile time) causes circumflex never to match.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_NOTEOL
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The end of the string is not the end of a line, so the dollar metacharacter
should not match it nor (except in multiline mode) a newline immediately before
it. Setting this without PCRE_MULTILINE (at compile time) causes dollar never
to match.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_NOTEMPTY
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
An empty string is not considered to be a valid match if this option is set. If
there are alternatives in the pattern, they are tried. If all the alternatives
match the empty string, the entire match fails. For example, if the pattern
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  a?b?
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
is applied to a string not beginning with "a" or "b", it matches the empty
string at the start of the subject. With PCRE_NOTEMPTY set, this match is not
valid, so PCRE searches further into the string for occurrences of "a" or "b".
</P>
<P>
Perl has no direct equivalent of PCRE_NOTEMPTY, but it does make a special case
of a pattern match of the empty string within its <B>split()</B> function, and
when using the /g modifier. It is possible to emulate Perl's behaviour after
matching a null string by first trying the match again at the same offset with
PCRE_NOTEMPTY set, and then if that fails by advancing the starting offset (see
below) and trying an ordinary match again.
</P>
<P>
The subject string is passed as a pointer in <I>subject</I>, a length in
<I>length</I>, and a starting offset in <I>startoffset</I>. Unlike the pattern
string, it may contain binary zero characters. When the starting offset is
zero, the search for a match starts at the beginning of the subject, and this
is by far the most common case.
</P>
<P>
A non-zero starting offset is useful when searching for another match in the
same subject by calling <B>pcre_exec()</B> again after a previous success.
Setting <I>startoffset</I> differs from just passing over a shortened string and
setting PCRE_NOTBOL in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind of
lookbehind. For example, consider the pattern
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  \Biss\B
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
which finds occurrences of "iss" in the middle of words. (\B matches only if
the current position in the subject is not a word boundary.) When applied to
the string "Mississipi" the first call to <B>pcre_exec()</B> finds the first
occurrence. If <B>pcre_exec()</B> is called again with just the remainder of the
subject, namely "issipi", it does not match, because \B is always false at the
start of the subject, which is deemed to be a word boundary. However, if
<B>pcre_exec()</B> is passed the entire string again, but with <I>startoffset</I>
set to 4, it finds the second occurrence of "iss" because it is able to look
behind the starting point to discover that it is preceded by a letter.
</P>
<P>
If a non-zero starting offset is passed when the pattern is anchored, one
attempt to match at the given offset is tried. This can only succeed if the
pattern does not require the match to be at the start of the subject.
</P>
<P>
In general, a pattern matches a certain portion of the subject, and in
addition, further substrings from the subject may be picked out by parts of the
pattern. Following the usage in Jeffrey Friedl's book, this is called
"capturing" in what follows, and the phrase "capturing subpattern" is used for
a fragment of a pattern that picks out a substring. PCRE supports several other
kinds of parenthesized subpattern that do not cause substrings to be captured.
</P>
<P>
Captured substrings are returned to the caller via a vector of integer offsets
whose address is passed in <I>ovector</I>. The number of elements in the vector
is passed in <I>ovecsize</I>. The first two-thirds of the vector is used to pass
back captured substrings, each substring using a pair of integers. The
remaining third of the vector is used as workspace by <B>pcre_exec()</B> while
matching capturing subpatterns, and is not available for passing back
information. The length passed in <I>ovecsize</I> should always be a multiple of
three. If it is not, it is rounded down.
</P>
<P>
When a match has been successful, information about captured substrings is
returned in pairs of integers, starting at the beginning of <I>ovector</I>, and
continuing up to two-thirds of its length at the most. The first element of a
pair is set to the offset of the first character in a substring, and the second
is set to the offset of the first character after the end of a substring. The
first pair, <I>ovector[0]</I> and <I>ovector[1]</I>, identify the portion of the
subject string matched by the entire pattern. The next pair is used for the
first capturing subpattern, and so on. The value returned by <B>pcre_exec()</B>
is the number of pairs that have been set. If there are no capturing
subpatterns, the return value from a successful match is 1, indicating that
just the first pair of offsets has been set.
</P>
<P>
Some convenience functions are provided for extracting the captured substrings
as separate strings. These are described in the following section.
</P>
<P>
It is possible for an capturing subpattern number <I>n+1</I> to match some
part of the subject when subpattern <I>n</I> has not been used at all. For
example, if the string "abc" is matched against the pattern (a|(z))(bc)
subpatterns 1 and 3 are matched, but 2 is not. When this happens, both offset
values corresponding to the unused subpattern are set to -1.
</P>
<P>
If a capturing subpattern is matched repeatedly, it is the last portion of the
string that it matched that gets returned.
</P>
<P>
If the vector is too small to hold all the captured substrings, it is used as
far as possible (up to two-thirds of its length), and the function returns a
value of zero. In particular, if the substring offsets are not of interest,
<B>pcre_exec()</B> may be called with <I>ovector</I> passed as NULL and
<I>ovecsize</I> as zero. However, if the pattern contains back references and
the <I>ovector</I> isn't big enough to remember the related substrings, PCRE has
to get additional memory for use during matching. Thus it is usually advisable
to supply an <I>ovector</I>.
</P>
<P>
Note that <B>pcre_info()</B> can be used to find out how many capturing
subpatterns there are in a compiled pattern. The smallest size for
<I>ovector</I> that will allow for <I>n</I> captured substrings in addition to
the offsets of the substring matched by the whole pattern is (<I>n</I>+1)*3.
</P>
<P>
If <B>pcre_exec()</B> fails, it returns a negative number. The following are
defined in the header file:

The subject string did not match the pattern.

<P>
Either <I>code</I> or <I>subject</I> was passed as NULL, or <I>ovector</I> was
NULL and <I>ovecsize</I> was not zero.

<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_ERROR_BADMAGIC       (-4)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
PCRE stores a 4-byte "magic number" at the start of the compiled code, to catch
the case when it is passed a junk pointer. This is the error it gives when the
magic number isn't present.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_ERROR_UNKNOWN_NODE   (-5)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
While running the pattern match, an unknown item was encountered in the
compiled pattern. This error could be caused by a bug in PCRE or by overwriting
of the compiled pattern.

  PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY       (-6)

If a pattern contains back references, but the <I>ovector</I> that is passed to
<B>pcre_exec()</B> is not big enough to remember the referenced substrings, PCRE
gets a block of memory at the start of matching to use for this purpose. If the
call via <B>pcre_malloc()</B> fails, this error is given. The memory is freed at
the end of matching.

<LI><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="#TOC1">EXTRACTING CAPTURED SUBSTRINGS</A>
<P>
Captured substrings can be accessed directly by using the offsets returned by
<B>pcre_exec()</B> in <I>ovector</I>. For convenience, the functions
<B>pcre_copy_substring()</B>, <B>pcre_get_substring()</B>, and
<B>pcre_get_substring_list()</B> are provided for extracting captured substrings
as new, separate, zero-terminated strings. A substring that contains a binary
zero is correctly extracted and has a further zero added on the end, but the
result does not, of course, function as a C string.
</P>
<P>
The first three arguments are the same for all three functions: <I>subject</I>
is the subject string which has just been successfully matched, <I>ovector</I>
is a pointer to the vector of integer offsets that was passed to
<B>pcre_exec()</B>, and <I>stringcount</I> is the number of substrings that
were captured by the match, including the substring that matched the entire
regular expression. This is the value returned by <B>pcre_exec</B> if it
is greater than zero. If <B>pcre_exec()</B> returned zero, indicating that it
ran out of space in <I>ovector</I>, the value passed as <I>stringcount</I> should
be the size of the vector divided by three.
</P>
<P>
The functions <B>pcre_copy_substring()</B> and <B>pcre_get_substring()</B>
extract a single substring, whose number is given as <I>stringnumber</I>. A
value of zero extracts the substring that matched the entire pattern, while
higher values extract the captured substrings. For <B>pcre_copy_substring()</B>,
the string is placed in <I>buffer</I>, whose length is given by
<I>buffersize</I>, while for <B>pcre_get_substring()</B> a new block of memory is
obtained via <B>pcre_malloc</B>, and its address is returned via
<I>stringptr</I>. The yield of the function is the length of the string, not
including the terminating zero, or one of
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY       (-6)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
The buffer was too small for <B>pcre_copy_substring()</B>, or the attempt to get
memory failed for <B>pcre_get_substring()</B>.
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING    (-7)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
There is no substring whose number is <I>stringnumber</I>.
</P>
<P>
The <B>pcre_get_substring_list()</B> function extracts all available substrings
and builds a list of pointers to them. All this is done in a single block of
memory which is obtained via <B>pcre_malloc</B>. The address of the memory block
is returned via <I>listptr</I>, which is also the start of the list of string
pointers. The end of the list is marked by a NULL pointer. The yield of the
function is zero if all went well, or
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
  PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY       (-6)
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
if the attempt to get the memory block failed.
</P>
<P>
When any of these functions encounter a substring that is unset, which can
happen when capturing subpattern number <I>n+1</I> matches some part of the
subject, but subpattern <I>n</I> has not been used at all, they return an empty
string. This can be distinguished from a genuine zero-length substring by
inspecting the appropriate offset in <I>ovector</I>, which is negative for unset
substrings.
</P>
<P>
The two convenience functions <B>pcre_free_substring()</B> and
<B>pcre_free_substring_list()</B> can be used to free the memory returned by
a previous call of <B>pcre_get_substring()</B> or
<B>pcre_get_substring_list()</B>, respectively. They do nothing more than call
the function pointed to by <B>pcre_free</B>, which of course could be called
directly from a C program. However, PCRE is used in some situations where it is
linked via a special interface to another programming language which cannot use
<B>pcre_free</B> directly; it is for these cases that the functions are
provided.
