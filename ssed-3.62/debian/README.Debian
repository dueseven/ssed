ssed for Debian
---------------

ssed is packaged as a stand alone package. It does not use the alternatives
mechanism or divert /usr/bin/sed. The ssed upstream maintainer has taken
over the maintenance of GNU sed also. This package may go away if all
features in ssed get merged into a future version of GNU sed.
